            <p>
              For dim sum, we do not take reservations. In order to be certain that your party gets a table, please arrive early and allow the host to put you and your party in the queue.

              For dinner, please call us at 510-895-1818 and let us know the time, date, and number of people for your reservation.

            <p className='has-text-weight-bold'>Do you serve dim sum during dinner?</p>
            <p>Dim sum is traditionally enjoyed only during brunch time and we want to stay true to original practice. So, we do not serve dim sum during dinner.</p>
