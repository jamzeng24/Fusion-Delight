# Fusion Delight (Restaurant Website)

This is a GitHub repository of the current iteration of Fusion Delight, a local dim sum restaurant in San Leandro. Updates will be made to this repository as long as Fusion Delight needs to put content on their webpage.

This is a [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) project created using the tutorial on their website as a starter with `gatsby new`.

I decided to use Gatsby.js as a personal challenge since I have no previous experience with the framework. Being a React-based library, I could potentially further my current knowledge of React.

## Requirements

Node.js

## Getting Started

Navigate to the project root directory.

Run `npm run start`

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

This application is currently deployed at [https://fusiondelight.gatsbyjs.io](https://fusiondelight.gatsbyjs.io) using [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/products/cloud/).
